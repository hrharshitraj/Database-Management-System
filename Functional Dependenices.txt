Functional Dependencies-
	- Some attribute depends on another attribute, as name suggests;

The functional dependency is a relationship that exists between two attributes. It typically exists between the primary key and non-key attribute within a table.

FD: x --> y;
y is functionally dependent on x;
x determines y;
x -> Determinant;
y -> Dependent;
value of x will be given from which you can search tha value of y from the table;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's not that the value of y will be calculated/computed from the given value of x;
x = 5, y=x^2+3 -> y=5^5+3 -> y = 28, No, that doesn't happen;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We need to follow some rules to check if there is functional dependencies in this table-  |------|		
	      	|x    y|
		|------|
		|1    1|
		|2    1|
		|3    2|
		|4    3|
		|------|
If x = 2 is given, y =?
From the table we can tell that y = 1;

		|------|
	      	|x    y|
		|------|
		|1    1|
		|2    1|
		|3    2|
		|4    3|
		|2    5|
		|------|
Now, what's the value of y if x=2 given?
If x is same at both the points, y value must must be same in both tuples;
y -> 1,1 || y -> 5,5;
x can not determine y here, No functional dependencies between x and y;
You need to find if there is functional dependency in the table based on relations given in the table.

|--------------------------------|
|Functional dependency-		 |
|If t1.x = t2.x,		 |
|then t1.y must be equal to t2.y;|
|--------------------------------|
|Not a Functional dependency-	 |
|If t1.x != t2.x,		 |
|then, even if t1.y = t2.y;	 |
|--------------------------------|
|Functional dependency-          |
|If x is unique in the table,	 |
| no need to check anything,	 |
|   x --> y			 |
|--------------------------------|

x and y can also be set of attributes as well;

 ------|------|-------|-------|--------		FD: x-->y,
   1   |  a   |	 78   |	 CS   |	  c1	  	if t1.x = t2.x,
   2   |  b   |	 60   |	 EE   |	  c2		then, t1.y = t2.y;

* RNo. --> Name, Unique RNo. Functional dependency;
* Name --> RNo, t1.a = t2.a, t1.1 != t2.3, Not a Functional dependency;
FD ->	t1.a = t2.a,
        t1.78 = t2.78;
FD ->   t1.b = t2.b,
	t2.60 = t2.60;
* Name --> Marks, When t1.x = t2.x, always t1.y = t2.y, Functional dependency;
* Marks --> Name, t1.80 = t2.80, t1.c != t2.d, Not a Functional dependency;
* Marks --> Dept, t1.80 = t2.80,
		  t1.IT != t2.EC, Not a Functional dependency;
* Dept --> Course, t1.CS = t2.CS,
		   t1.c1 != t2.c2, Not a Functional dependency;

~ Functional Dependencies taking set of attributes-
* RNo.,Name --> Marks
    (x)          (y) 
  Unique values, If RNo. is unique, RNo.,x,y,etc, would be a Functional dependency to any other tuple;
* Name,Marks --> Dept
     (x)         (y)
- Functional Dependency,   FD -> t1.x(a,78) = t2.x(a,78),
        			 t1.CS = t2.CS;
* If Name,Marks --> Dept is a Functional dependency, Name,Marks --> Dept,Course may/may not be a Functional dependency;
Here, Not a functional dependency, t1.x(a,78) = t2.x(a,78)
				   t1.y(CS,c1) != t2.y(CS,c2);

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a relational database management, functional dependency is a concept that specifies the relationship between two sets of attributes where one attribute determines the value of another attribute.
It is denoted as X â†’ Y, where the attribute set on the left side of the arrow, X is called Determinant, and Y is called the Dependent. 

Functional dependencies are used to mathematically express relations among database entities.
