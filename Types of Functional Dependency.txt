Types of Functional Dependency (X-->Y)-
1. Trivial
2. Non-Trivial
3. Multi-valued
4. Transitive

1. Trivial Functional Dependency-
In Trivial Functional Dependency, a dependent(y) is always a subset of the determinant(x).
If y is subset of x, then x-->y is a trivial functional dependency;

x-->x is also a trivial fd as x is obviously x subset of x;
It's like I give you the roll no. of a student and ask you to tell me the roll no. of that same student;

RNo-->RNo -> Trivial
RNo,Name-->Name	-> Trivial
RNo,Name-->RNo -> Trivial

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Non-Trivial Functional Dependency-
x-->y, but the intersection of x and y is null, nothing common between x and y, then it's a non-trivial fd;
RNo-->Name -> Non-trivial fd, Not sure if it's functional dependency or not, need to look at the table to check;

Or, x-->y, and y is not a subset of x, then also it's a non-trivial fd(Semi-trivial);
RNo,Name-->Name,Marks
  (x)         (y)
y is not subset of x, but intersection of x and y is also not null as Name is common in both x and y, so it may be termed as a semi-trivial fd;
