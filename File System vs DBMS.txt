File System vs DBMS-
File system comes with the Operating System.

Hard disk -> File System -> Notepad
             (Interface)
Due to file system only, we manage to put different files at different places.  (Folders -> Sub-folders -> Directories -> Files)

We can only manage small amount of data by file system, it's not a good idea to use file system when it comes to large amount of data.

Now, Hard disk -> File System -> MySql file
We still use file system, its just that now data is managed by DBMS.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE SYSTEM -> To manage small database:
No data type is defined, raw unstructured data is directly stored in hard disk;
Unstructured data -> Data which is not structured using some pre-defined data models or schemas.
80% of the data is unstructured data;

Drawbacks of File System-
---------------------------
` No specific format defined-
02/11/2023 -> DD/MM/YYYY
11/02/2023 -> MM/DD/YYYY
$ In DBMS, Specific format is defined as there is Structured data.

` You need to know the location of the file you want to search data from;
What if more than one user is accessing the data, how would everyone know the file location?
			 User1
			    |
			    |
			|--------|
	    User4_______|File	 |______User2
			|Location|
			|--------|
			    |
			    |
			 User3
Data might also be stored at remote location, you'll not be able to know the location.
$ In DBMS, You simply write the name of the file you want to access and you'll get the data without knowing anything about the address where its stored;

` You have a file of 10Gb, you want to just access a small detail whose size is 5Mb, you write a program in C/C++/Java language, here all the 10Gb data will be extracted which is not feasible at all.
$ DBMS will just give you the exact data you are looking for.

` For each query, you need to write and compile a complete program.
$ In DBMS, write One simple query, you get the result, again write one simple query and you'll get the next result. No need to write whole program and compile it everytime.

` Data Redundancy, discussed already;
` Inconsistency.
$ In DBMS, Flexible access of the data is possible.

` Concurrent access -> One file, Multiple users;
      Both users are reading is okay;
      One user is writing and other is reading, violation of concurrency;
      Other user should read only when the 1st user is done with writing;
   ~ In file system, there is not concurrency protocol;
$ In DBMS, we have this protocol;

` Integrity.
` Security -> You can secure whole file, but if you want to hide or secure a part of the file and open it the other parts, its not possible in file system.
Mechanism for security is much more stronger in DBMS;

DBMS -> To manage large database;
Pre-defined Structure data;
You need to define the data type of values stored in the table.
Searching becomes very easy on structured data.
