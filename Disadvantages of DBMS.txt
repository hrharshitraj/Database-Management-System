Disadvantages of DBMS:
1. Cost of Hardware and Software: It requires a high speed of data processor and large memory size to run DBMS software.
2. Size: It occupies a large space of disks and large memory to run them efficiently.
3. Complexity: Database system creates additional complexity and requirements.
4. Higher impact of failure: Failure is highly impacted the database because in most of the organization, all the data stored in a single database and if the database is damaged due to electric failure or database corruption then the data may be lost forever.
Though, it provides backup and recovery subsystems which create automatic backup of data from hardware and software failures and restores the data if required.
